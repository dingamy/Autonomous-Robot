# Robot Project
Autonomous wall following robot implementing PID control with two opposing lateral ultrasonic sensors that can traverse through an obstacle course. It is able to detect an open tunnel and accurately traverse through it with <1cm of clearance on each side, adjust itself to travel in a straight line, and use the front touch sensor to detect walls. 

Coded for the BrickPi
